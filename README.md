Sebastian
===================

Sebastian is a virtual butler to watch your door. It can show any webpage you tell him to show in a file that he's watching. Just change its contents and he'll refresh its webpage.

This software is meant to work in a private environment in which door status of whats inside is needed (know if there are workers inside etc.)

You can use this software to show if your store is opened, and to refresh live the work hours. Also it is useful to show info in a webpage that you want passersby to know.

----------

How to use
-------------

Sebastian is fairly simple. Just open sebastian.py with a python interpreter, select a file to watch and start sebastian. It will autorefresh whenever that file is changed.

> **Note:**

> - Sebastian needs [PySide](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PySide/) to work. Install it with pip (pip install PySide).
